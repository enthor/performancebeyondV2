PREFACE:

This is Version 2 of a document titled, "Performing Beyond One's
Abilities". If you would like a copy of Version 1, email me via

non-commercial, non-redistributive use only.

"Mindfulness+Flow" is a practical mental technique for improving
performance, especially for tasks requiring problem-solving,
creativity and invention. It is not a Way. Also, humans have practiced
various mental disciplines for thousands of years and it is very
unlikely that "Mindfulness+Flow" is a new invention. My words are new,
that is all.

The name, "Mindfulness+Flow", was chosen for clarity with American
readers because the terms "Mindfulness" and "Flow" are in common use
and it is possible to convey some meaning using those words.

Some kinds of knowledge cannot be explained with words; for these
experience is required, and words are just signals, hints, or poetic
allusions to ineffable truths. I know that the technique described
here works because I use it. I can explain it for you but I cannot
understand it for you. If, after reading this document, you are
interested in pursuing the topic further it will be simple for you to
do research and read more, but practice and work will be required to
fully understand the benefits and limitations.
