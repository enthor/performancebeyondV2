Poetry: Lord Alfred Tennyson

	"Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; 
	Death closes all: but something ere the end, 
	Some work of noble note, may yet be done, 
	Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. 
	The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: 
	The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep 
	Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 
	'T is not too late to seek a newer world. 
	Push off, and sitting well in order smite 
	The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
	To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
	Of all the western stars, until I die."

	- Lord Alfred Tennyson, "Ulysses"


Metaphysics: David Deutsch

	"All of them agree with Everett’s original
	theory that generically, when an experiment
	is observed to have a particular result, all
	the other possible results also occur and are
	observed simultaneously by other instances of
	the same observer who exist in physical
	reality – whose multiplicity the various
	Everettian theories refer to by terms such as
	‘multiverse’, ‘many universes’, ‘many
	histories’ or even ‘many minds’."

	--David Deutsch, The Clarendon Laboratory,
	University of Oxford, "The Logic of
	Experimental Tests, Particularly of
	Everettian Quantum Theory", June 2016


Pataphysics: Alfred Jarry

	"... pataphysics as an idea that 'the virtual
	or imaginary nature of things as glimpsed by 
	the heightened vision of poetry or science 
	or love can be seized and lived as real.'"

	Pataphysics, Wikipedia

Cat: "Pookey"

	(I'd upload her pic but I doubt that github wishes
	to be known as a repository of cat pictures...)
 

Numbers: Douglas Adams

	"recipriversexcluson, a number whose 
	existence can only be defined as being 
	anything other than itself"

	"Recipriversexclusons now play a vital 
	part in many branches of math, including 
	statistics and accountancy and also form 
	the basic equations used to engineer the 
	Somebody Else's Problem field."

	--Douglas Adams, "Life, the Universe and
	Everything"


Novels: John le Carré and Martin Cruz Smith

	"There was only now, Goethe was right. There 
	was no tomorrow because tomorrow was the 
	excuse. There was now, or there was nowhere."

	―-John le Carré, "The Russia House"

	"It doesn't matter how ridiculous a lie is if 
	it is your only chance of escape. It doesn't 
	matter how obvious the truth is if the truth 
	is that you'll never escape."

	―-Martin Cruz Smith, "Gorky Park"
