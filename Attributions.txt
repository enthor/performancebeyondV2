	"If you want the ultimate, you've got to be willing to pay the
	ultimate price. It's not tragic to die doing what you love."


3) lines 57 & 259: "TANSTAAFL: There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch."

	--From Robert Heinlein's "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress". Origin: apocryphal,
	apparently. See:

4) Various: Attention+Intention, feeling of sleepiness while studying.

	--"The Playmasters" by John Dalmas and Rod Martin has long been a
	favorite of mine and I re-read it prior to writing version 2.
	Although a work of fiction, it is clear that the authors
	contemplated heightened mental states involved in performance
	improvement.

5) Various: Step 3.4.3

	--"Quarantine", by Greg Egan. Another sci-fi novel... Motivational
	rather than prescriptive. One takeaway for me was the importance
	of formulating a firm Intention at the start and resolving any
	doubts at that time.

6) Various

	--"Paths To Otherwhere", by James P. Hogan. Motivational rather
	than prescriptive. As with "Quarantine", I will defer to actual
	quantum physicists about the nature of reality... But this is an
	inspiring and interesting book which I enjoyed and I have thought
	about it many times. 


7) Lines 542-557: "neural quantum computations"

	--"New theory of consciousness proposed by Surrey Scientist", 
	Professor Johnjoe McFadden, Oct 20, 2020.
